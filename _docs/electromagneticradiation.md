Electromagnetic (EM) radiation arises from oscillating **electric** and **magnetic** fields. It can be considered either as a stream of quanta (photons, particles) or waves.

### EM radiation as waves

Concerning the wave aspect, it is a sinusoidally varying electric and magnetic field vector pointing at right angles to one another and to the direction of the travel of the wave.

#### Definitions:

| **Amplitude (A)** | peak field strength |   |
| **Wavelength (λ)** | distance between successive peaks | Units = m (metres) |
| **Time (T)** | time between successive peaks | Units = seconds |
| **Frequency (f)** | the number of peaks passing a given point in one second | f = 1/T\
Units = s-1 (per second) or Hz (hertz, 1Hz = 1 cycle per second) |
| **Velocity (c)** | the distance travelled by a peak in one second |

velocity = frequency x wavelength

v = f x λ

### EM radiation as particles

When considering EM radiation as particles, the particles are small packets, or quanta, of energy called **photons** that travel in straight lines. The energy of the photon packet is measured in joules but this is inconveniently small when describing EM radiation so the unit of **electron-volt** is used.

1 ev = 1.6 x 10-19 J

#### Intensity

The intensity (i.e. photon energy or field strength) is related to the characteristics of the wave by **Planck's constant**.

E = hf

Key:

E = photon energy\
h = Planck's constant\
f = frequency

Rearranging the earlier equation of velocity = fλ and assuming that the velocity if fixed (i.e. 1) gives you:

f = 1 / λ

In other words, the frequency is inversely proportional to the wavelength. Substituting this into the Planck's constant equation gives you:

E = h / λ

i.e. the photon energy is inversely proportional to the wavelength.

###   Key points

-   As the frequency increases, so does the energy of the wave (directly proportional)
-   As the wavelength increases the energy of the wave decreases (inversely proportional)


### Definitions

![Diagram representing a beam emanating from a point source](https://www.radiologycafe.com/images/physics/science-pointsource@2x.png "Diagram representing a beam emanating from a point source")

The diagram represents a beam emanating from a point source (S). As the beam moves further from the source it spreads (area B is larger than area A).

**Photon fluence = number **of photons per unit area at a given time and given cross-section of beam (e.g. **number **of photons in area A or B)

**Energy fluence = **total amount of **energy** of different photons at a given time at a given cross-section of the beam per unit area (**total energy** of photons in area A or B)

**Energy fluence rate**** (aka beam intensity) = **total **energy per unit area** passing through a cross section **per unit time**(watts/mm2) (**total energy per second** of photons in area A or B).

### Inverse square law

As the beam moves further from the source the area of the beam increases. The area of the beam is the distance squared.

A ∝ d2

Key:

A = area\
d = distance

This means the same number of photons are spread over a larger area and the strength of the beam decreases (the intensity is inversely proportional to the area).

intensity ∝ 1 / A

Putting the two equations together gives:

intensity ∝ 1 / d2

This relationship between the distance from the source and the energy of the beam is the **inverse square law** as the intensity is inversely proportional to the distance from the source squared.

However, this law only strictly applies if:

-   Beam coming from point source
-   No scatter or absorption of the beam
