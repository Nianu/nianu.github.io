Dysphagia
===========

Causes
--------
>**List the common causes of dysphagia**

####**Dysphagia** = Difficuly in swallowing
####**Odynophagia** = Pain on swallowing

**Pharyngeal/Oesophageal**

  * [Tonsilitis](tonsilitis.jpg)
  * Mysathenia Gravis 
	* Autoimmune neuromuscular disease
	* Circulating antibodies block the ACh receptors at the post-synaptic neuromuscular junction
  * Upper Oesophageal Achalasia 
	* Failure of smooth muscle fibres to relax
  * Cerebrovascular Accident

Note: Most common cause is a CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident) causing damage to the 9th, 10th and 12th cranial nerves

**Oesophageal**

  * Achalasia
	* Destruction of ganglion cells in myenteric plexus
		* Lose ability to relax lower oesophageal sphincter
		* Disordered oesophageal motility
	* Massive dilation of lower oesphagus
		* Due to food piling above tightened sphincter
	* [Bird-beak sign](birdbeak.jpg)
		* Combination of massive dilation and tightened sphincter
	* Increased risk of oesophageal SCC (Squamous Cell Carcinoma)
  * Oesophageal Web
	* Mucosal layer protrudes causing partial/total obstruction
	* Occurs in upper oesophagus
	* Increased risk for oesophageal SCC (Squamous Cell Carcinoma)
  * [Plummer-Vinson Syndrome](plummer-vinson.png)
	* Oesophageal Web
	* Severe iron-deficiency anaemia
		* Presents with angular chelitis
	* Beefy red tounge
		* Atrophic Glossitis due to atrophy of mucosa
		* Red colour due to exposed blood vessels
  * Luminal Obstruction
	* Carcinoma
  * Scleroderma
	* Thickening of oesophageal wall

**External**

  * Diabetes
	* Motility disorders in upper GI tract -> Delayed Gastric emptying
  * Chagas' Disease 
	* American trypanosomiasis -> Tropical parasite disease
	* Cell death causes inflammatory response and fibrosis
	* Secondary Achalasia
  * Goitre
	* Particularly retrosternal

Investigations
--------
>**Discuss investigations of dysphagia**

Symptoms of Malignancy
--------
>**List the symptoms suggestive of an oesophageal malignancy**

####Clinical Features

  * Age group is **60-70 years**
  * **Dysaphagia** is the most common symptom
  * **Retrosternal** chest pain
  * Coughing
  * Aspiration into lungs

Pathology of Malignancy
--------
>**Describe the pathology and natural history of oesophageal malignancy**

####Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)

  * Male
  * Heavy Drinkers
  * Heavy smokers
  * Regional lymph node spread - early and common

####Adenocarcinomas

  * Arise from columnar-lined epithelium
  * Heavy Drinkers
  * Heavy smokers
  * Regional lymph node spread - early and common

Heading

SubHeading
----------

  * list item 1
  * list item 2

  This is a hyperlink to [Google](http://google.com).

  Images are like hyperlinks, but with an exclamation mark in front of them:

MDwiki uses the [GitHub flavored markdown dialect][gfm], so you can i.e. add tables:

    | Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
    | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
    | col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
    | col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
    | zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

See the [GitHub Markdown Cheatsheet][gfmsheet] for detailed GFM reference.

Making a website out of it
--------------------------

All you have to do is upload your markdown files with an `.md` file extension together with the [mdwiki.html][download] and access them via the hashbang `#!` character:

    http://example.com/mdwiki.html#!myfile.md

It is advised that you create an `index.md` file which serves as a starting point for your wiki when no parameter is given - in this case MDwiki will automatically fetch and display the `index.md`. If you also rename the `mdwiki.html` file into `index.html`, there are no parameters required and you can access your wiki at `http://example.com/`!

- - - -

Adding a navigation
-------------------

Create a `navigation.md` file in the same directory as the `mdwiki.html` and put in the links that make up your menu:

```
# Your wiki name

[Home](home.md)
[About](about.md)
[Download](download.md)

```

The first line is a Markdown heading, which will be used as the website brand in the navbar. Standard Markdown links are to be used for the navbar entries.

For more complex menus, nesting submenu items as a list and using horizontal lines that will be rendered as dividers is also possible:

```
# Brand name

[Menu Item 1]()

  * # SubMenu Heading 1
  * [SubMenu Item 1](subitem1.md)
  * [SubMenu Item 2](subitem2.md)
  - - - -
  * # SubMenu Heading 2
  * [SubMenu Item 3](subitem3.md)
  - - - -
  * # SubMenu Heading 3
  * [SubMenu Item 3](subitem3.md)

[Menu Item 2](item2.md)
- - - -
[Menu Item 3](item3.md)
```

If a bulleted list of links is supplied as in the above example, the list will become a dropdown in the navigation bar displaying a submenu. In order for this to work, the toplevel link has to have an empty target (see Menu Item 1 in the above example). Dropdown headings are also possible by prepending a single `#` in front.

Creating links
-------

Links to anywhere in the web are done via regular Markdown links:

    [Google](http://www.google.com)

Links within the wiki are just plain relative links:

    [Go to download](download.md)

Internal links will be prefix automatically with the `#!` hashbang:

[Go to download](download.md)

Images
-------

Images are regularly placed as in standard markdown using the `![alt](href "title")` notation. MDwiki will create a nice highlight-like popup if you click an image. You can group images together by __not__ putting an empty line in between them.

Example:

    ![](http://placekitten.com/g/1200/300 "A kitten")

    ![](http://placekitten.com/g/550/450 "First of two kittens")
    ![](http://placekitten.com/g/550/450 "Second of two kittens")

    ![](http://placekitten.com/g/400/350)
    ![](http://placekitten.com/g/400/350)
    ![](http://placekitten.com/g/400/350)

Will be rendered as:

![](http://placekitten.com/g/1200/300 "A kitten")

![](http://placekitten.com/g/550/450 "First of two kittens")
![](http://placekitten.com/g/550/450 "Second of two kittens")

![](http://placekitten.com/g/400/350)
![](http://placekitten.com/g/400/350)
![](http://placekitten.com/g/400/350)

### Images as Links

To use an image as a link, use the following syntax:

    [![ImageCaption](path/to/image.png)](http://www.linktarget.com)

    Example:
    [![A kitten](http://placekitten.com/g/400/400)](http://www.placekitten.com)

[![A kitten](http://placekitten.com/g/400/400)](http://www.placekitten.com)

Syntax highlighting
-------------------

MDwiki supports [GFM][gfm] like syntax highlighting. Put the name of the language after the backticks in the code block:

    ```javascript
    var hello = function () {
        // say hello
        alert('Hello world!');
    }
    ```

Will render as:

```javascript
var hello = function () {
    // say hello
    alert('Hello world!');
}
```

Currently the following languages are supported:

|Language       |Keyword      |
|---------------|-------------|
|Bash           |bash         |
|C#             |csharp       |
|Clojure        |clojure      |
|C++            |cpp          |
|CSS            |css          |
|CoffeeScript   |coffeescript |
|CMake          |cmake        |
|HTML           |html         |
|HTTP           |http         |
|Java           |java         |
|JavaScript     |javascript   |
|JSON           |json         |

|Python         |python       |
|Ruby           |ruby         |
|R              |r            |
|SQL            |sql          |
|Scala          |scala        |
|Vala           |vala         |
|XML            |xml          |


Gimmicks
--------

Through the usage of [Gimmicks][gimmicks], which are like plugins, you can add much more dynamic elements into your wiki and use it in a very advanced way. See the [Gimmicks][gimmicks] page for a full reference.
